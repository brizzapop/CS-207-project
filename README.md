# CS-207-project
This is a beginner project for my computer science course at the University of Regina.
The project is called Preset Piano Arduino and it is built from a previously made project called "Unravel Preset Piano Easy Arduino (Even A Ghoul Can Make It)" by ExeCuteLi. This project is essentially a replication of a piano and when a button is pressed, a preset song is played from the piezo speaker. In the original project I found online, the song was an Anime theme song called “Unravel” from a show called Tokyo Ghoul. To make this project more of my own, I decided to choose a different song, which is “Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2” by Pink Floyd. 
This project uses pushbuttons as “piano keys” and each pushbutton represents a different note, so it is replicating a piano. When a button is pressed, the piezo speaker on the breadboard plays a sound. One of the pushbuttons is different from the others because when it is pushed, a preprogrammed song plays in full, but does not loop.
